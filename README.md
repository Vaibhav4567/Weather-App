# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with React, using Material-UI components for the user interface. It allows users to search for the weather information of any city and displays details such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and more. The app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Search Box**: Allows users to input a city name and fetch weather data for that location.
- **Weather Details**: Displays temperature, humidity, minimum/maximum temperatures, feels-like temperature, and weather description.
- **Weather Icons**: The app shows corresponding weather icons based on the current weather conditions (Sunny, Rainy, or Cold).
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to be responsive, making it user-friendly across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: For styling and responsive design.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching weather data.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For app functionality and logic.

## How It Works

1. Users enter the name of a city in the search box.
2. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. It displays the current weather, including the temperature, humidity, weather description, and other relevant information.
4. The app also shows an appropriate weather icon (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold) depending on the current weather conditions.
